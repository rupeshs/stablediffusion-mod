# **Stable Diffusion Dream Script**

This is a fork of
[CompVis/stable-diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion),
the open source text-to-image generator. It provides a streamlined
process with various new features and options to aid the image
generation process. It runs on Windows, Mac and Linux machines,
and runs on GPU cards with as little as 4 GB or RAM.

_Note: This fork is rapidly evolving. Please use the
[Issues](https://github.com/lstein/stable-diffusion/issues) tab to
report bugs and make feature requests. Be sure to use the provided
templates. They will help aid diagnose issues faster._

# Installation

This fork is supported across multiple platforms. You can find individual installation instructions below.

- ## [Linux](docs/installation/INSTALL_LINUX.md)
- ## [Windows](docs/installation/INSTALL_WINDOWS.md)
- ## [Macintosh](docs/installation/INSTALL_MAC.md)

## **Hardware Requirements**

**System**

You wil need one of the following:

- An NVIDIA-based graphics card with 4 GB or more VRAM memory.
- An Apple computer with an M1 chip.

**Memory**

- At least 12 GB Main Memory RAM.

**Disk**

- At least 6 GB of free disk space for the machine learning model, Python, and all its dependencies.

**Note**

If you are have a Nvidia 10xx series card (e.g. the 1080ti), please
run the dream script in full-precision mode as shown below.

Similarly, specify full-precision mode on Apple M1 hardware.

To run in full-precision mode, start `dream.py` with the
`--full_precision` flag:

```
(ldm) ~/stable-diffusion$ python scripts/dream.py --full_precision
```

# Latest Changes

- v1.14 (11 September 2022)

  - Memory optimizations for small-RAM cards. 512x512 now possible on 4 GB GPUs.
  - Full support for Apple hardware with M1 or M2 chips.
  - Add "seamless mode" for circular tiling of image. Generates beautiful effects. ([prixt](https://github.com/prixt)).
  - Inpainting support.
  - Improved web server GUI.
  - Lots of code and documentation cleanups.

- v1.13 (3 September 2022

  - Support image variations (see [VARIATIONS](docs/features/VARIATIONS.md) ([Kevin Gibbons](https://github.com/bakkot) and many contributors and reviewers)
  - Supports a Google Colab notebook for a standalone server running on Google hardware [Arturo Mendivil](https://github.com/artmen1516)
  - WebUI supports GFPGAN/ESRGAN facial reconstruction and upscaling [Kevin Gibbons](https://github.com/bakkot)
  - WebUI supports incremental display of in-progress images during generation [Kevin Gibbons](https://github.com/bakkot)
  - A new configuration file scheme that allows new models (including upcoming stable-diffusion-v1.5)
    to be added without altering the code. ([David Wager](https://github.com/maddavid12))
  - Can specify --grid on dream.py command line as the default.
  - Miscellaneous internal bug and stability fixes.
  - Works on M1 Apple hardware.
  - Multiple bug fixes.

# Contributing

Anyone who wishes to contribute to this project, whether documentation, features, bug fixes, code cleanup, testing, or code reviews, is very much encouraged to do so. If you are unfamiliar with
how to contribute to GitHub projects, here is a [Getting Started Guide](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github).

A full set of contribution guidelines, along with templates, are in progress, but for now the most important thing is to **make your pull request against the "development" branch**, and not against "main". This will help keep public breakage to a minimum and will allow you to propose more radical changes.
