# **Frequently Asked Questions**

Here are a few common installation problems and their solutions. Often these are caused by incomplete installations or crashes during the
install process.

---

**QUESTION**

During `conda env create -f environment.yaml`, conda hangs indefinitely.

**SOLUTION**

Enter the stable-diffusion directory and completely remove the `src` directory and all its contents. The safest way to do this is to enter the stable-diffusion directory and give the command `git clean -f`. If this still doesn't fix the problem, try "conda clean -all" and then restart at the `conda env create` step.

---

**QUESTION**

`dream.py` crashes with the complaint that it can't find `ldm.simplet2i.py`. Or it complains that function is being passed incorrect parameters.

**SOLUTION**

Reinstall the stable diffusion modules. Enter the `stable-diffusion` directory and give the command `pip install -e .`

---

**QUESTION**

`dream.py` dies, complaining of various missing modules, none of which starts with `ldm``.

**SOLUTION**

From within the `stable-diffusion` directory, run `conda env update -f environment.yaml` This is also frequently the solution to
complaints about an unknown function in a module.

---

**QUESTION**

There's a feature or bugfix in the Stable Diffusion GitHub that you want to try out.

**SOLUTION**

**Main Branch**

If the fix/feature is on the `main` branch, enter the stable-diffusion directory and do a `git pull`.

Usually this will be sufficient, but if you start to see errors about missing or incorrect modules, use the command `pip install -e .` and/or `conda env update -f environment.yaml` (These commands won't break anything.)

**Sub Branch**

If the feature/fix is on a branch (e.g. "_foo-bugfix_"), the recipe is similar, but do a `git pull <name of branch>`.

**Not Committed**

If the feature/fix is in a pull request that has not yet been made part of the main branch or a feature/bugfix branch, then from the page for the desired pull request, look for the line at the top that reads "_xxxx wants to merge xx commits into lstein:main from YYYYYY_". Copy the URL in YYYY. It should have the format `https://github.com/<name of contributor>/stable-diffusion/tree/<name of branch>`

Then **go to the directory above stable-diffusion** and rename the directory to "_stable-diffusion.lstein_", "_stable-diffusion.old_", or anything else. You can then git clone the branch that contains the pull request:

```
git clone https://github.com/<name of contributor>/stable-diffusion/tree/<name
of branch>
```

You will need to go through the install procedure again, but it should be fast because all the dependencies are already loaded.
